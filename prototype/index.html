            <h2>Old Reliable</h2>
            <p>

                Gordo was one of the first monkeys to make it into space as part of NASA's space program. Eight monkeys
                had
                flown on NASA missions before him, five of whom went by the name of Albert.
            </p>

            <p>
                Gordo's historic flight took place on <strong>December 13, 1958</strong> when he took off from Cape
                Canaveral for a 15 minute
                flight into space. Even though he was weightless for over 8 minutes the on-board instruments indicated
                that
                Gordo enjoyed his journey into space. Scientists monitorin the flight were pleased to note that the only
                slight side effect Gordo suffered from the entry into space was a modest slowing of his pulse.

            <div>

                <em>The rocket carrying Gordo into space would take off from the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape
                    Canaveral,
                    travel further than any monkey </em> had ever travelled before - over 1,500 miles - and reach a
                height of 310
                miles (500 km) before returning to Earth and landing in the South Atlantic, 1,302 nautical miles south
                of Cape Canaveral.

                think
                that they're gonna send a monkey up to do a man's work ... what they're trying to do to us is send a man
                up
                to do a monkey's work"</blockquote>

        <h3>The Jupiter AM-13</h3>
        <p>The Jupiter IRBM (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile) was originally developed by the US Army as a
            long-range successor to its PGM-11 Redstone missile, but was eventually taken over and deployed by the USAF
            for political reasons. It was also the only one of the United States' early stategic ballistic missiles with
            some mobility.</p>
